# Event Storming

We already learned a lot about the Fee Office. What's missing is a better understanding of the processes.

**What happens when?**

**What are the preconditions for certain actions?**

**How does the happy path look like?**

**And do we need to take care of some unhappy paths as well?**

Many questions, right? Fortunately, [@ziobrando](https://github.com/ziobrando){: class="alert-link"} has developed a flexible workshop format
called [EventStorming](https://www.eventstorming.com/resources/){: class="alert-link"}. Follow the link for a comprehensive list of resources regarding the topic.

## Basics

EventStorming is really easy to learn and all sessions I did myself had amazing results. I can only recommend to read about it, watch a few presentations and
buy the book [Introducing EventStorming](https://www.eventstorming.com/book/) by Alberto Brandolini (@ziobrando).

For the Fee Office we started simple again. EventStorming works best with all people in one room and unlimited modeling space.
However, we tried remote EventStorming using a [realtimeboard](https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9J_kzYG5GQ=/).
Obviously, you can't achieve the same quality results in a remote session, especially when communication happens asynchronous via chat (or github issue in our case).

But it's still a great way for collaboration and for sharing ideas. Here are the basic colors for different types of sticky notes:
