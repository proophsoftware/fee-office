Think of those modules as (mico)services deployed together. That said, we combine autonomy of bounded contexts (implemented as modules) with the ease of deploying and operating a monolithic system. Because we keep modules separated (even on database level) we are able to split the system later and scale up individual modules if needed. We also keep the model of each context decoupled from the other models - a very important property of a system that is constantly improved and reshaped."},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/about.html#1-1-3-1","title":"Infrastructure","content":" Docker &amp; Docker Compose Nginx PostgreSQL "},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/about.html#1-1-3-2","title":"Programming Language","content":" PHP 7.x "},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/about.html#1-1-3-3","title":"API Gateway &amp; Module System","content":" zend\/expressive "},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/about.html#1-1-3-4","title":"Dependency Mgmt","content":" composer "},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/about.html#1-1-3-5","title":"Event Sourcing","content":" Event Machine "},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/about.html#1-1-3-6","title":"State Persistence","content":" PostgreSQL Document Store Continue with setting up the demo application using Docker.

Each context is represented as a software module in our system. But we don't use a monolithic MVC module approach like you know from ZendFramework 2 modules or Symfony bundles. Instead we use the lightweight module system provided by Zend Expressive.The technique used in the demo is not bound to zend expressive. We've picked it because expressive uses PSR standards and has a module system that works the way we need it. Anyway, you can achieve the same project structure using any existing PHP framework and composer. We recommend asking the respective framework community if you're not sure how to do it with your framework of choice."},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/module_system.html#1-3-1","title":"The Rules","content":"Each module should be completely independent of any other module even if all modules are deployed on the same server.To achieve module autonomy we use a special set up. It is a combination of Expressive modules which are also composer packages. More on that in a minute. Furthermore, an application layer acts as the glue layer to coordinate communication between users\/clients and modules as well as between the modules \"talking\" to each other. Each module has its own URL root path, f.e. the RealtyRegistration module uses the path \/realty\/.... Each module has its own composer.json and only uses dependencies defined in that composer.json OR provided by the application layer. Each module has at least a dedicated database schema assigned to it, if not its own database(s). No module is allowed to use a class or function defined in another module. The following diagram illustrates the architecture:If we later want to deploy one or more modules separated from the others (turn a module into a microservice), we can \"easily\" do that by deploying the module together with the application layer and globally defined dependencies provided by the application layer."},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/module_system.html#1-3-2","title":"Application Layer","content":"We've installed the zend\/expressive-skeleton with Fastroute, zend\/servicemanager, no template engine and the Whoops error handler. We've also enabled the module system of expressive.The application takes over a few tasks: It uses the zend-component-installer to install our modules. The installer is a composer plugin registered in the root composer.json of the application layer. It merges module config and provides env vars via app.env It performs routing of http requests using Fastroute It provides an error handler (Whoops) and could also include authentication and authorization (not included in the demo) It provides client libraries available for all modules, f.e. a logger, a service bus + basic message classes, etc. The application layer uses the App namespace."},{"id":"https:\/\/proophsoftware.github.io\/fee-office\/intro\/module_system.html#1-3-3","title":"Modules","content":"A module has its own namespace. For example the RealtyRegistration module uses the namespace FeeOffice\\RealtyRegistration. The namespace maps to the path src\/RealtyRegistration\/src.A module also has its own composer.json where all dependencies of the module should be defined.A module is not allowed to use dependencies that are not defined in its own composer.json. The only exception are global dependencies (client libraries) provided or imported by the application layer. At the moment this is a convention and needs to be ensured by code reviews. In the future we might add a tool that performs automated code scans to ensure that rule.In the application's root composer.json each module is included as local package:\"repositories\": [ { \"type\": \"path\", \"url\": \"src\/RealtyRegistration\" } ], \"require\": { \"php\": \"^7.1\", \"feeoffice\/realty-registration\": \"*\", Example of importing the RealtyRegistration module as package in the root composer.jsonWe use composer to manage module dependencies and add the module namespace to the autoloader. That said, each module can require its own dependencies but as long as modules are deployed together, composer makes sure that different dependency versions don't conflict with each other.Defining module dependencies per module makes it much easier to deploy them independently later.Each module has a config provider and the zend-component-installer composer plugin automatically adds each config provider to the expressive config manager of the application layer. This way, modules provide their own routing and middleware pipe configuration as well as module specific DI definitions.Clean and nice separation of concern which makes it very very easy to build a true modularized application with the option to turn it into microservices if needed.That's enough technical detail for now. On the next page you'll get a first overview of the domain."}]
